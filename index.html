      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>  My name is Mike McShane. I recently turned 30 and currently live in Lake Oswego with my wife Katy and cat Winston. I currently work at a sales agency, but am taking this course so I can hopefully start a new career in programming.</p>
      <p>Outside of work and school I enjoy cooking, exploring Portland's food and bar scene, and curling. I also enjoy travelling and hope to explore more of the world soon.</p>
      <p>Below you will find links to the previous projects I've been working on for this class.</p>
